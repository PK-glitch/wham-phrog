<p>The Battlefield franchise has a history of complex easter 
eggs in their games. in Battlefield 1, they took it to another level, with the Peacekeeper easter egg.</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK6vqvhOx-k">This is a guide for how to get the Peacekeeper</a>
<br>

<p>There are 7 things you need to have to get the Peacekeeper, these are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The 'A Beginning' dogtag</li>
  <li>The 'A Conflict' dogtag</li>
  <li>The 'An Omen' dogtag</li>
  <li>The 'Angel sighting' back dogtag</li>
  <li>The 'Belly of The Beast' back dogtag</li>
  <li>The 'An Escalation' skin for the m1918 MG</li>

<br>
  
  <p>Once you have done all of these easter eggs, you will<br>
  <p>have to go into the map Paschendaele and do a final easter egg<br>
  <p>to finally unlock the Peacekeeper revolver.</p>
  
  
  <p>What you unlock is the most powerful revolver, with some<br>
  <p>incredible, smoothe animations which make you feel like you've<br>
  <p>achieved something great that not very many people have.</p>
